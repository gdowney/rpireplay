# **DivePi**

DivePi is primarily a diving video replay system for use in dryland diving training.  

DivePi utilizes Raspberry Pi 3's, Raspberry Pi Cameras (8MP), HDMI cables, and Ethernet cables ran through a 
network switch and a master CPU running Ansible to display selected diving replay programs.  A separate program 
utilizes Kodi to provide access for each monitor to a physical XHD for replaying captured videos.
